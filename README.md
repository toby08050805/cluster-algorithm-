This project is to implement the recommendation system. This system can help
company gain their profit because of promote their products. In this project, I need to
implement the recommendation system which can predict the score of movies. The
movies I predict have not seen by the user. we predict the movies score base on
another usersâ€™ movie score. We can predict through the result to recommend the user
movie they may like. The dataset is from MovieLen which provides 970 users score
in 9216 movies. I use k-nearest-neighbors (KNN) and Collaborative Filtering (CF) to
implement this system.
